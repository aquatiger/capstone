Musilux is a name I invented; I found out later it was already used by others
that I didn't know about.

The idea of this program is to visualize each note rather than just
impressions of notes. Hopefully, deaf persons and/or persons hard of
hearing will eventually enjoy this display.

I received help programming from Kieran Prasch, my instructor at PDX Code
Guild, Zach Kollar, who did much of the coding and looking for libraries,
and Matthew Cooper who generated the piano/lightshow images.

Presently the program does not manage polyphony. I've seen other programs
that do. There doesn't seem to be any other programs that exactly do what
I want, although black midi does in a different way.

Plan to continue to learn about and implement polyphony in Musilux.
